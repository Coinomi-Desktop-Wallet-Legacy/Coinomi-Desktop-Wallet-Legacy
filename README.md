## About

This build of Coinomi Desktop Wallet is designed specifically to support **old `.wallet` backup files** created in **Coinomi versions 1.2.3 and 1.2.2**. These legacy versions are the last known builds compatible with early encrypted `.wallet` formats used before changes introduced in the 1.3.x line.

Use this build if you need to **restore backups made in older versions of Coinomi** or access `.wallet` files that no longer open in current releases.
